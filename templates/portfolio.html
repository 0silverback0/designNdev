          High Roller is a mock Medical Marijuana store where a user can search for products
          using selected filters, and add products to a cart. This app uses Python and Flask
          on the backend, along with PostgrSQL and SQLAlchemy. One thing I struggled with was
          properly filtering items with multiple filters such as by THC and brand.
